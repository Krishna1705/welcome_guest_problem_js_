# welcome_guest_problem_js_
This is welcome guest problem program,solved using Javascript. here i have used includes() method of array.
firstly we add all guest users inside an array.then guest user will visit website & need to enter his/her name.
then we will check particular guest name is existed inside array or not with the help of includes() method,which return boolean value
if guest user is already existed inside an array then guest user will get welcome msg, otherwise guest will not be allowed.
